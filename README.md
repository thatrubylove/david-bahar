# I am the readme for a ruby gem or rails app
## I should be the first thing you ever do in a repo
### I will help you design your software so you dont chase your tail or write bad interfaces!

This is a paragraph.

Typically I like to define my 'interface' here via:

## Usage

```ruby
# anything in here will be rendered as code, in this case, ruby code

i_am_a_lambda = ->(param1, param2) {
  puts "%s and %s" % [param1, param2]
}
```


some more shit here


some other shit we do towards being able to run our new feature with no bugs


of course, all the time we are writing tests and they move us closer to knowing 'when' we are 'done' and 'if' that shit even really works. Your tests are the only thing that will allow you to sleep at night and not miss deadlines or have 'regression' bugs continually come back, losing you confidence and customers and revenue and employees
