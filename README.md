# I am the readme for a ruby gem or rails app
## I should be the first thing you ever do in a repo
### I will help you design your software so you dont chase your tail or write bad interfaces!

This is a paragraph.

Typically I like to define my 'interface' here via:

## Usage

``ruby`
# anything in here will be rendered as code, in this case, ruby code

i_am_a_lambda = ->(param1, param2) {
  puts "%s and %s" % [param1, param2]
}
```
